Lab Description:

This lab is to design a controller for traffic lights that face one traffic direction. There are three
colors of lights, represented with Red, Yellow, Green LEDs. The traffic lights operate in the
following patterns:
(1) At the start of the system (power up), the Red light flashes until a button is pressed
(2) The Red light stays on for 15 seconds before the Green light is turned on
(3) The Green light stays on for 15 seconds before switching the Yellow light on
(4) The Yellow light stays on for 3 seconds before switching back to Red light
(5) The R-G-Y pattern continues until the system is powered off
(6) An active buzzer beeps for 3 seconds before a light is changed.
Additional requirements for EECE.5520 students
(7) A four-digit 7-Segment display shows the time (in seconds) remaining for each light
